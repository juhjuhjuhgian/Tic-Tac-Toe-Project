This was a group project with two other 100Devs engineers. Both were more experienced than me, but I learned a lot while working through the assignment with them. Some things I learned: 1) The use of 'childNodes' to target the child element of an HTML item. 2) Targeting a class, storing it in a variable, then turning that variable and iterating through it using a forEach loop. Then adding an event listener to each box section. This was refactored from having intial code of nine separate lines of event listeners. 3) Using the .classList property to target elements. 4) Reviewing CSS tools like flex-wrap, justify-content, and border-box
